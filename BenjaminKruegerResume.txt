Full Time Position, Sept 2009 - Aug 2011

Senior System Administrator, Security Engineer
Working as the Senior operations staff, I led Junior operations staff to maintain and monitor a fleet of 80+ Linux servers providing testing, integration, corporate and production infrastructures. These environments include large scale Web, Mail, Load Balancing, Database, and other network services. I also managed network security, including maintaining compliance with PCI specifications. In addition to upgrading an aging Fedora Core based platform to CentOS on Amazon's EC2, I automated a significant majority of the infrastructure with Puppet as well as designed and built a PCI compliant network for the secure transmission, processing, and storage of credit card data. Working closely with the development team on a daily basis, I assisted with production troubleshooting and provide 24x7x365 on-call support. This integration with the development team has also yielded architectural improvements including moving back-end and front-end services to redundant load balancer systems for greater availability. In addition to production operations, I also managed corporate technology including network and workstation management for offices in Washington and California. After our acquisition by Google, I continued performing the duties listed above while helping to facilitate the acquisition and transition process.
