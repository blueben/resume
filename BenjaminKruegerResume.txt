Summary

 I am an experienced and talented Engineer with both deep and wide experience in many technologies and computing environments. I believe the most effective teams are diverse, cohesive, and service oriented, and I try to employ a philosophy of leading by example. Much of my best work is done in the areas of system design and implementation, research, and the dissection and analysis of unique or complex problems. I highly value professional development, information sharing and collaboration with industry peers as well as open source technologies and philosophies.

 I help technology teams align themselves to business needs by developing flexible yet well-defined processes, using repeatable methods to design systems and solve problems, and creating strong relationships with other teams within the organization. Not only does this improve a technology team’s quality of life, but they are more responsive, better understand the organization’s needs, and deliver better technology solutions in a way that enables every team to work with less friction and more efficiency.
